# My NixOS Configuration

## What is it?

Currently testing and playing with NixOS. I have 3 profiles setup, with the main
one being the laptop. The other 2 are derivatives of that, with setup being to 
simply comment out the packages/settings that are not in use.

## Things to do

- [ ] Move over remaining dotfiles
- [ ] Solidify the sync settings across devices
- [ ] Finish moving the theming to base16
- [ ] Add language servers for helix editor
- [ ] *Maybe* clean the file paths in the home-manager configs
- [ ] Add screenshots
